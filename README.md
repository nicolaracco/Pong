# PONG

My own implementation of Pong in Unity with a very simple AI.

After having read [this article on gamedev](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/your-first-step-to-game-development-starts-here-r2976) I've decided to write my own implementation of Pong to have a completed project.

It's very minimal, with a pretty stupid AI, but it works :)

You can play it [via browser](https://nicolaracco.github.io/Pong) or [download the windows and osx binaries](https://nicolaracco.github.io/Pong/releases).
